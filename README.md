# ML Model Evaluation

This project aims to develop a web application using the Streamlit library of Python. The app allows users to upload a dataset and select an independent variable. Based on the provided data, the app evaluates and suggests the best machine learning model.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload datasets in CSV format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and understand the dataset.
- **Model Selection**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Display evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/best-ml-model-finder.git
cd best-ml-model-finder
```

2. Install the required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app :

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

4. Upload your dataset in CSV format.
5. Select the features and target variable.
6. View the EDA, model evaluation, and suggested best model.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Any other dependencies can be added to requirements.txt

## Future Enhancements

* Add more machine learning models for evaluation.
* Implement hyperparameter tuning.
* Enhance data visualization capabilities.
* Provide detailed model performance reports.
* Integrate additional data preprocessing options.
